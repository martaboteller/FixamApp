This is the final project of a course entitled <i>Desenvolupament d'aplicacions per a dispositius Android, IOS i PWA (FS17-21)</i> carried out at CIFO School thanks to a grant from the Generalitat of Catalonia and the European Union.

The general idea of this application is to allow registered users to share captured photos with the intention of reporting defects and promoting the proper use of public and/or community facilities. At the same time this webapp will hopefully facilitate consensus and attract attention by the competent authorities.

It works in a very easy and intuitive way: a registered user takes a photo, adds a caption title and a description. This capture can be stored as public or private. It is possible to view the collection of captures in a list or on a map. Each user can see their own captures and the public ones, and, at the same time  they can give a "vote" to each capture.
